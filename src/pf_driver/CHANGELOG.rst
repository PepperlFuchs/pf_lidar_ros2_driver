  R2000 fix
* Fix parsing TCP streams/packets
  UDP transport puts one PSDF packet per UDP packet; TCP jams all PSDF packets into a single stream which is often delivered in chunks that don't match the size of the actual TCP packets.
  Here, we make two changes to account for this:
  1. Restructure the parser to parse an arbitrary number of packets iteratively from its buffer (avoid multiple recursion, though it's probably fine).
  2. Restructure the writer to persist any unused bytes from the previous parse and prepend them to the next packet that comes in over the network.
* Validate buffer size based on packet header
  Original implementation compared the computed data size (based on sizes in the packet header) to the buffer size less the nominal size of the known packet header structure.  However, some (I guess older?) R2000s use a smaller packet header (60 bytes vs 76).  Trying to parse packets from these devices results in almost universal failure, the original condition ends up being "does the packet have at least 16 extra bytes at the end" to which the answer is usually "no" (except if the packet is part of a TCP stream and has the beginning of the next PFSDP packet immediately after it in the buffer).
  This code is still not ideal, as the first few data bytes are also parsed into the header in that case, so we'll end up with some header fields that might be invalid (with no indication to the user).  It also doesn't modify the outer check (in `include/pf_driver/pf/pf_parser.h`) that verifies that there's at least as much data as the expected header size, so in rare cases (packets with only a few points) we may drop (or delay) those packets; however that should be fairly uncommon (packet sizes are based on scan parameters and AFAICT tend to avoid nearly empty packets).
* Default to packet type C for R2000
  Basically no reason to use type A; we know how to parse all three types, A and C use the same space, and C gives us additional information.
  Don't alter the default for R2300, (which I believe means it uses type C1?)
  This also requires us to add the necessary arguments to `request_handle\_{tcp,udp}` in the PFSDP protocol header.
* Refactor HTTP get calls in request_handle\_{tcp,udp}
  - Refactor HTTP get call to allow passing std::map in addition to initializer list (initializer lists are great for quick use, but make constructing complicated queries difficult, since they are immutable)
  -> Expect this to come in handy if additional arguments to the handle request are added later (e.g. start angle, max number of points per scan, etc)
  - Properly construct query based on which arguments have been specified
* Parse R2000 packet type B properly
  Useful code was commented out for some reason.  Changing it slightly to
  match the other packet types and for more efficiency.
* Publish echo amplitudes as intensities in ROS LaserScan messages
  Except for R2000 packet type A, which doesn't include intensity

  Minor fixes for dynamic reconfigure on R2000
* Only set up one dynamic reconfigure server per node
  Otherwise only the later of the two is active (I think?) and we end up unable to use dynamic reconfigure on R2000.
  Also move the server setup to a more sensible place, now that this is
  getting more complicated.
* Fix a few R2000 config parameters
  several "value" fields weren't appropriately set (spaces, or longer names used instead), and one of the "Watchdog" enum values had a copy/paste error.
